## Landscape

* SAP is a software company that provides ERP systems to businesses of various sizes and across many different industries.
* One of the major trends for software companies over the past 5-10 years has been the use of the cloud to store data.  Another trend is the low-code/no-code applications for businesses to use.  This makes it easier for companies to make minor modifications to their business software.
* According to Forbes Advisor, the top competitor to SAP are Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, Syspro, QT9, Epicor Prophet 21 ERP, oracle Net Suite One World, Acumatica and IFS [Top SAP Competitors (2023) – Forbes Advisor] (https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/sap-competitors/#:~:text=The%20Best%20SAP%20Competitors%20of%202023%201%20Microsoft,businesses%20%28SMBs%29%207%20IFS%3A%20Best%20for%20service%20providers).

## Recommendations

The use of Joule, the SAP Personal Assistant, allowing customer to interact with their systems is a great addition.  
* A feature to enhance their product could be suggestions for customers as they are using the software.  For instance, they could ask if they would like to analyze the data in a different way.  Also, they could show items that may be nearing a threshold – similar to predictive statistical process control (SPC) or statistical quality control (SQC) using statistics to monitor and control the quality of their processes.
    >"There are not any other companies doing this natively that I could find in my research.  This would give them a definite advantage over their competition.  The only predictive SPC that I found in researching was companies with costs in the millions."  
* SAP could utilize machine learning AI to create predictive statistical process controls for customers to utilize in their daily processes – giving customers the ability to predict changes before they happen. 
* Machine learning AI technologies learn from the data.  SAP already utilizes many types of data processing.  Adding machine learning would be a natural fit for applications.
